We have multiple Microservices in our project like Student, Exam , Marks , and to access them through PostMan ,user has to remember the url(name and port).

Suppose if we had 50 microservices then user has to learn 50 different urls.
So we dont use microservices by directly calling them , instead we use API Gateway.We send request to API Gateway and it then sends request to particular microservice.

An API Gateway is a server that acts as an intermediary between clients and backend services, providing a centralized point of access for multiple APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It serves as a single entry point for clients to access various functionalities provided by different microservices or backend systems.

Here are some key functions and features of an API Gateway:

1. **Request Routing**: API Gateways route client requests to the appropriate backend service based on predefined rules, URL paths, or parameters.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**: API Gateways handle authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized clients can access specific APIs and resources. This includes enforcing access control policies, validating API keys, OAuth tokens, or integrating with identity providers.

3. **Security**: API Gateways often provide security features such as encryption, SSL/TLS termination, and rate limiting to protect against common security threats like DDoS attacks, injection attacks, and unauthorized access.

4. **Traffic Management**: They manage and control the flow of traffic between clients and backend services, including load balancing, caching responses, and managing spikes in traffic to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

5. **Monitoring and Analytics**: API Gateways offer monitoring and analytics capabilities to track API usage, performance metrics, errors, and logs. This helps in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing APIs, and troubleshooting issues in real-time.

6. **Transformation and Protocol Conversion**: They can transform requests and responses between different data formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and protocols (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket), making it easier for clients and services to communicate effectively.

7. **API Lifecycle Management**: API Gateways facilitate API versioning, documentation, and deployment, enabling developers to manage the entire API lifecycle from development to retirement efficiently.

API Gateways play a crucial role in modern microservices architectures and API-driven development, providing a unified interface for consuming and managing APIs across diverse environments and platforms.
